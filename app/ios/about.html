        <h3>Carat: collaborative detection of energy bugs</h3>
        <p>Carat is a research project from the AMP Lab at UC Berkeley that helps detect and diagnose battery problems. After collecting data about your device for <i>about a week</i>, it will give you personalized recommendations.<p>
        <p>The <b><i>Actions</i></b> list tells you how to make <i>your</i> battery last longer and how much improvement to expect.<p>
        <p><b><i>Bugs</i></b> are apps that use a lot of energy on a small number of devices, including yours. Restarting a buggy app may improve battery life.<p>
        <p><b><i>Hogs</i></b> are apps that are correlated with higher energy use across many devices. Closing hogs may improve battery life.<p>
        <p>Carat collects and reports generic usage statistics about your phone that allow it to do its job; this process involves absolutely no personally identifying information. Period.<p>
        <p>Carat is under development, so please check back often to see new results. The more you use it, the better it will get. You can read more about the research on the <a href=\"http://carat.cs.berkeley.edu\">Carat Project page</a> and <a href=\"http://carat.cs.berkeley.edu/eula.html\">view the EULA here</a>.<p>
