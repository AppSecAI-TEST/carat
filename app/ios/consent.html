        <h3>Consent to Data Collection</h3>
        <p>In order to perform its function, Carat must periodically collect generic information about your device and how you are using it. This information includes the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>what apps are running,</li>
            <li>the % battery remaining,</li>
            <li>memory and cpu utilization,</li>
            <li>a unique device ID,</li>
            <li>the battery state (e.g., plugged in), and</li>
            <li>the OS version and phone model.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We <b>DO NOT</b> collect any personally identifying information: no names, no email addresses, no private data from other apps, and so on. Although Carat does use iOS's location services to detect whether you are moving around, it doesn't record your absolute location. Carat has a <a href="http://github.com/amplab/carat">public github repository</a>, so you don't need to take our word for it.</p>
        
        <p>Carat periodically sends this information to our servers, where we do math on it and subsequently share the results with you. Carat tries to do all of this unobtrusively. Although we encourage you to open Carat every now and then so it can send us new data, you can pretty much forget it's running until you'd like to investigate a battery problem.</p>
        
        <p>Carat is an academic research project. We reserve the right to publish our results and to release the data into the public domain. (Remember: the data does not identify you in any way.) We will never sell your data or use it to advertise to you.</p>
        
        <p>We respect your privacy and value your trust. When you downloaded Carat, you agreed to our <a href="http://carat.cs.berkeley.edu/eula.html">EULA</a>, which contains additional information. If you have any questions or concerns, <a href="mailto:carat@eecs.berkeley.edu">just ask</a>.</p>
