        <h3>What does <i>Active Battery Life</i> mean?</h3>
        <p><i>Active Battery Life</i> estimates how long your battery would last
from full charge to zero if you were to actively use it.</p>
        <p>The energy consumption rate that is used is the average for your device and
usage.</p>
        <p>Roughly speaking, <i>Active Battery Life</i> ignores idle time.
It is not intended to be the same as your wall clock battery life.</p>
