        <p>You are looking at two probability distributions of the rate of energy use. Larger values further to the right mean a much higher rate of energy use (the x-axis is a log scale). Essentially, we took all of the energy rates Carat has measured across all devices and divided them into two sets. The content of each set, and which colored line it corresponds to, appears above the plot in a matching color.</p>

        <p> <b>Example:</b> A Hog plot shows one distribution for the set of measurements when the app was running and another for when it was not. You'll probably notice places where the distribution for "Running" is higher than the distribution for "Not Running". This is the underlying reason why Carat calls the app a Hog: running it correlates with atypically high energy use. Note that this is not simply saying that the app uses energy, which is obvious. The distribution for "Not Running" also includes measurements for when other apps are running. (All of them, in fact.) So a Hog doesn't just use energy, it uses so much energy that it stands out from the crowd.</p>
