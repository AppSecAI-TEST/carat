The latest Android build in this branch requires ActionBarSherlock, which is present here as a git
submodule. Download submodules to get it.

To compile with it, create a new Eclipse project with Import existing Android code into workspace
with the folder ActionBarSherlock/actionbarsherlock. Then copy the Android support library from
app/android/libs to ActionBarSherlock/actionbarsherlock/libs, replacing the one there.
